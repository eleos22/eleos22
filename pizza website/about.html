        <h1>I'm Eleosnel Rincon</h1>
        <h2>I love pizza and I also love learning how to code</h2>
        <p>I created this project to show my skills as I learn
             more every day. <br> Im no expert and I have to give
              credit to youtube and codeAcademy for helping me
               learn how to set some of the code up for this project. <br>
                Of course this project came to life through my
                imagination and work. <br> Im always open to getting
                advice and help from those who know more. 
                Thank you for checking out my work!  </p>
